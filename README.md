This project is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to view vehicle models based on the selected make and year. The application fetches data from an external API to retrieve a list of car makes and their available models for specific years. Users can select a make and year to see the corresponding models, with options for navigation and error handling in case of missing or incorrect data. The project also includes dynamic routing, server-side data fetching, and page rendering optimizations.
